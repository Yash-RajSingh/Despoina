## FAQ

#### What is bruteforcing?

A brute force attack uses *trial-and-error* to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess correctly. It is a popular and effective method. Generating a strong password will help you secure it.


#### What to do if my password is weak?

You may add a **combination** of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, special characters to make it stronger.

#### Can I use same password for multiple accounts?

To be fully secured, we suggest generating *different passwords* for different accounts. Using the same password for multiple accountes can put all of them at risk if your password gets compromised.

#### How to manage random passwords?

**Password managers** can help you easily manage these passwords. Some of them will even let you autofil it whenever needed. So you end up saving one password of the respective password manager only.
